		<div id="accessibilitySemanticMarkup" class="entry">
			<h3>Write Valid Semantic Markup</h3>
			<p>Each page should have exactly 1 <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag pair</p>
			<p>Semantic markup not only gives the human user of the site a better idea of hierarchy of content, but it also gives any machines attempting to ascertain importance or order from the content a better idea.</p>

		<div id="accessibilityAria" class="entry">
			<h3>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)</h3>
			<p>We can add extra accessibility to our already semantic code by adding aria attributes. Aria provides us with the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Roles to describe the type of widget presented, such as "menu", "treeitem", "slider", and "progressmeter"</li>
				<li> Roles to describe the structure of the Web page, such as headings, regions, and tables (grids)</li>
				<li> Properties to describe the state widgets are in, such as "checked" for a check box, or "haspopup" for a menu.</li>
				<li> Properties to define live regions of a page that are likely to get updates (such as stock quotes), as well as an interruption policy for those updatesâ€”for example, critical updates may be presented in an alert dialog box, and incidental updates occur within the page</li>
				<li> Properties for drag-and-drop that describe drag sources and drop targets</li>
				<li> A way to provide keyboard navigation for the Web objects and events, such as those mentioned above</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As of this writing, we typically focus on using aria-label, role and aria-hidden where applicable</p>

			<h3>Anchors</h3>
			<p>Anchor tags provide a way to navigate on-page as well as between two pages. They shouldn't be used as clickable elements unless they actually take you somewhere else. A good way to determine whether to use an anchor or span is to imagine viewing the page with javascript turned off. How does the element behave?</p>

			<h3>Images Need &lsquo;Alt&rsquo; Text</h3>
			<p>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag requires an <code>alt</code> text attribute to both validate and meet accessibility guidelines. The text in the <code>alt</code> attribute should be descriptive of what the image shows, or is trying to achieve.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;img src=&quot;dog.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Fido and I at the park!&quot; /&gt;

		<div id="accessibilityTables" class="entry">
			<h3>Use Tables for Tabular Data Only</h3>
			<p>Tables should only ever be used for the presentation of tabular data.</p>
			<p>When needed, table headers should always be presented using <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> elements. Remember to also set <code>cellpadding</code>, <code>cellspacing</code> and <code>border</code> values to <code>0</code> as these are more consistently controlled by CSS.</p>

		</div>
		<div id="javascriptLoopCacheArrayLength" class="entry">
			<h3>Loop Performance - Cache Array Length</h3>
			<p>Looping is arguably the most important part of JavaScript performance to get right. Shave a millisecond or two off inside of a loop, potentially gain seconds overall. One such way is to cache the length of an array so it doesnt have to be calculated every time the loop is iterated through.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
var toLoop = new Array(1000);

for (var i = 0; i &lt; toLoop.length; i++) {
	// BAD - the length has to be evaluated 1000 times
}

for (var i = 0, len = toLoop.length; i &lt; len; i++) {
	// GOOD - the length is only looked up once and then cached
}</pre>
			<h4>The Exception</h4>
			<p>If you're looping through an array to find and remove a particular item, this will alter the array length. Any time you change the array length by either adding or removing items from inside the loop, you will get yourself into trouble. Consider either re-setting the length or avoid caching it for this particular situation.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="javascriptLoopBreakContinue" class="entry">
			<h3>Loop Performance - Use &lsquo;break;&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;continue;&rsquo;</h3>
			<p>The ability to step over and out of loops is really useful in avoiding costly loop cycles.</p>
			<p>If you're looking for something inside of a loop, what do you do once you find it? Say the condition you're looking for is matched halfway through a 1000 item loop.
				Do you execute whatever you intend to do, and allow the loop to continue to iterate over the remaining 500 items, knowing that there's no chance it will hit an if statement? Nope! You break out of your loop, literally!</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
var bigArray = new Array(1000);

for (var i = 0, len = bigArray.length; i &lt; len; i++) {
	if (i === 500) {
		break;
	}
	console.log(i); // will only log out 0 - 499
}</pre>
			<p>Another problem is skipping over a particular iteration and then continuing on with the loop. While things like odds and evens are better managed by replacing <code>i++</code> with <code>i + 2</code>, 
				some conditions need to be specifically listened for, to then trigger the skip. Anything that prevent's running through an entire iteration is pretty handy.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
var bigArray = new Array(1000);

for (var i = 0, len = bigArray.length; i &lt; len; i++) {

		</div>
		<div id="javascriptReflow" class="entry">
			<h3>Minimising Repaints &amp; Reflows</h3>
			<p>Repaints and reflows relate to the process of re-rendering the DOM when particular properties or elements are altered. Repaints are triggered when an element's look is changed without altering its layout. Nicole Sullivan describes these changes in a thorough <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2009/03/27/reflows-repaints-css-performance-making-your-javascript-slow/" target="_blank">blog post</a> as style changes such as visibility or background-color.	Reflows are the more costly alternative, caused by changes that alter the layout of the page. Examples include the addition or removal of elements, changes to an element's width or height, and even resizing the browser window. Worst yet is the domino effect of reflows that cause ancestor, sibling and child elements to reflow.</p>
			<p>There is no doubt that both reflows and repaints should be avoided if possible, but how?</p>
			<h4>A Reflow Example</h4>
			<p>It's not that the following snippet is "bad code" exactly. But let's assume that the array <code>arr</code> has 10 items.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
var myList = document.getElementById(&quot;myList&quot;);

for (var i = 0, len = arr.length; i &lt; len; i++) {
	
	myList.innerHTML += &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; + arr[i].title + &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;; //reflow - appending to element
	
}</pre>
			<p>In the above <code>for</code> loop, a reflow will be triggered for every iteration of the loop. 10 iterations cause 10 reflows. </p>
			<p>Now consider the following:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
var constructedHTML = &quot;&quot;;

for (var i = 0, len = arr.length; i &lt; len; i++) {
	constructedHTML += &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; + arr[i].title + &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;; //no reflow - appending to string
}

document.getElementById(&quot;myList&quot;).innerHTML = constructedHTML; //reflow</pre>
			<p>In this scenario, the elements are being constructed within a string. Not a single reflow is created by the loop, as the DOM is not being altered. Only once the array has been completely looped through is the string then applied as the <code>innerHTML</code> of an object, causing the only reflow of the function.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="javascriptFeatureSniff" class="entry">
			<h3>Feature Sniff, Don't Browser Sniff</h3>
			<p>Does the client's browser support geolocation? Does the client's browser support web workers? HTML5 video? HTML5 audio? The answer used to be:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
if ($.browser.msie) {
	// no it doesn't
}</pre>

			<p>In steps <a href="http://www.modernizr.com" target="_blank">Modernizr</a>, a JavaScript library developed in part by industry dream-boat Paul Irish. 
				With wide adoption, tiny file-size and plenty of <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/docs/#s1" target="_blank">documentation</a>: implementing it is a no-brainer. 
				It creates a <code>Modernizr</code> object that contains the results of its detection tests, so checking feature support is as simple as the following:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
// old way of detecting canvas support
if (!!document.createElement('canvas').getContext) { ... }

// with Modernizr
if (Modernizr.canvas) { ... }</pre>
		</div>
		<h2 id="jquerySection">jQuery Specific</h2>
		<div id="jqueryChain" class="entry">
			<h3>Chain Like a Mad Dog</h3>
			<p>One of the best parts of jQuery is its function chaining. You've probably used it a bit, maybe a few simple calls one after another... but have you ever traversed the DOM like a mad dog? Take some time to familiarise yourself with the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/end/" target="_blank">.end()</a> function. It is critical for when you begin stepping up and down the DOM tree from your original selector.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
$(".quote")
	.hide()
	.find("a").text("Click here").bind("click",doStuff).end()
	.parent().removeClass().addClass("testimonial").draggable().end()
	.fadeIn("slow");</pre>
			<p>In the example above, the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/end/" target="_blank">.end()</a> function is used once we have finished doing things with a particular DOM object and want to traverse
			back up the DOM to the original object we called. We then load back up and dive back into the DOM.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="jqueryOptimiseSelectors" class="entry">
			<h3>Optimise Your Selectors</h3>
			<p>jQuery is pretty chill. It can do pretty much everything but make you coffee, and I hear that's in the roadmap for 2.0. One thing you have to be careful about is abusing the power that is the <a href="http://sizzlejs.com/" target="_blank">sizzleJS</a> selector engine.
				There are two strategies to overcome this: <em>caching the selector results</em> and <em>using efficient selectors</em>.</p>
			<h4>Caching Selector Results</h4>
			<p>Do a costly DOM query every time you want to change something, or store a reference to the element? Pretty clear choice.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
// before
$(".quote a").bind("click", doStuff); // DOM query eww

// now
$(".quote a").addClass("quoteLink"); // DOM query eww

// later
$(".quote a").fadeIn("slow"); // DOM query eww</pre>
			<p>Ignoring chaining, this is better:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
// before
var $quoteLinks = $(".quote a");  // the only DOM query
$quoteLinks.bind("click", doStuff);

// now
$quoteLinks.addClass("quoteLink");

// later
$quoteLinks.fadeIn("slow");</pre>
			<br />
			<h4>Using Efficient Selectors</h4>
			<p>So jQuery/sizzleJS can use CSS3 selectors like a boss, but what's the real cost? Behind the scenes the browser is hopefully using <code>document.querySelector()</code>, but there's also a fair chance it will be breaking down your selector string and querying the DOM manually.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
// an ID search is the quickest possible query, then it just takes a list of the childNodes and matches the class
$("#quoteList").children(".quotes"); 

// looks for the "foo" class only in the pre-defined bar element
$(".foo",bar); </pre>
		</div>
		<div id="jqueryForEachLoops" class="entry">
			<h3>A &lsquo;for&rsquo; Loop is Always Quicker Than a &lsquo;each()&rsquo; Loop</h3>
			<p>No matter what happens in the next few years of browser development, a native <code>for</code> loop will always be quicker than a jQuery <code>$.each()</code> loop. 
				When you think of what jQuery really is (a library wrapped around native JS functions) you begin to realise that the native underlying JavaScript is always going to be quicker. It's a tradeoff of run speed versus authoring speed.</p>
			<p>It is vital that a native <code>for</code> loop is always used for performance critical functions that could fire potentially hundreds of times per second. Examples include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Mouse movement</li>
				<li>Timer intervals</li>
				<li>Loops within loops</li>
			</ul>

		<h2 id="scssSection">SCSS</h2>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
		<div id="scssDefinition" class="entry">
			<h3>What SCSS is</h3>
			<p>SCSS gives us power to compartmentalize our styling rules so we can easily cut out unused sections, just by deleting a file. It also lets us condense static values into variables, giving us an easier path to maintenance or updates. Mixins can add extra functionality, giving us a way to add vendor prefixes or calculate values on the fly.</p>
			<p>SCSS contains a similar structure to plain CSS, but instead of writing longer chains of deep selectors, each level can be nested inside of its parent, helping visualization of precedence of each rule.</p>

		<h2 id="cssSection">CSS</h2>
		<div id="cssBoxModel" class="entry">
			<h3>Understanding the Box Model is Key</h3>
			<p>The "box model" is a key determining factor in how a browser renders your page. A healthy understanding of it's intricacies will make your job so indescribably easier. The box model denotes the way in which the physical dimensions of a HTML element are calculated. If a block element has a fixed width of say, 100px, then how should the padding, border and margin be placed?</p>
			<p>Plenty of websites offer in depth descriptions, but put simply: the standards compliant implementation places the border and padding outside of the specified width. It's best explained with a graphic. Consider this code:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
/* the old way (178 + 20 + 2 = 200) */
.foo {
	width: 150px;
	height: 150px;
	padding: 25px;
	border: 25px solid;
	margin: 20px;
}</pre>

			<h4>What You Would Expect (Quirks Mode)</h4>
			<p>The padding and border are calucated inward, preserving the height and width specifically set to be 150px.</p>
			<p class="imageFeature"><img src="includes/images/box-model-quirks.png" alt="Box Model - Quirks Mode"></p>
			<h4>What You Get (Standards Compliant Mode)</h4>
			<p>Instead, you get 250px. 150px + (2 * 25) + (2 * 25).</p>
			<p class="imageFeature"><img src="includes/images/box-model-standard.png" alt="Box Model - Standards Mode"></p>
			<p>If you think it seems odd, you're not alone. There is a fix at hand, and it involves a CSS property called <code>box-sizing</code>, and it works in <strong>IE8 and above</strong>. It allows you to choose the exact way in which an elements dimensions are calculated, and its a lifesaver. Parameter support varies and vendor prefixes apply, so consult <a href="http://caniuse.com/css3-boxsizing" target="_blank">caniuse</a> for specifics.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
/* the old way (178 + 20 + 2 = 200) */
.foo {
	width: 178px;
	padding: 10px;
	border: 1px;
}

/* a better way */
.foo {
	width: 200px;
	padding: 10px;
	border: 1px;
		-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
		-moz-box-sizing: border-box;
		box-sizing: border-box;
}</pre>
		<p>While it was always possible to mentally calculate widths by removing pixel units from each other (as per the first method), it was never entirely clear how to do so with variable width units like percentages and EMs. There was no other solution at this point besides wrapping elements in parent elements to ensure widths and <code>padding/margin/borders</code> could all be separate.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="cssFloatOrPosition" class="entry">
			<h3>Know when to Float, and when to Position</h3>
			<p>Gone are the days of table based layouts. The moment we admit that we can concentrate our efforts into better understanding the way floats and positions work. There's a particular mental model that needs to be grasped, and I believe this is something best done with practise.</p>
			<p>Floats are great for sucking elements out of the DOM and forcing them hard up against a left or a right edge. They became the bread and butter of the post table layout stage in front end dev, possibly because of the poor browser support of <code>display: inline</code> and <code>inline-block</code>, as well as <code>z-index</code> bugs stemming from position support. These days there really is no excuse. Inline-block is fairly well supported, and a quick hack will get it working in IE7.</p>
			<p>The arguments that previously held back absolutely positioning elements with CSS have thankfully died down. In theory, positioning allows you to place elements on a page (or within any container for that matter) with Xs and Ys in a straightforward manner that should be familiar to people like Flash developers.</p>

			<h4>Understanding Positions</h4>
			<p>It's important to understand one fact when positioning elements with CSS: the position is always relative to the nearest positioned parent element. When people first start dabbling with CSS, there's a common misconception that <code>position: absolute;</code> positions right up to the page root. I think this stems from the fact that, yes, without any parent elements with position styles - this is true. It traverses up the DOM tree, not finding any positioned elements, and settles on the root of the page.</p>
			<p>So if <code>position: absolute;</code> pulls elements out of their normal flow, how do you position an element relative to it's parent? That's straight forward. The parent element needs to by styled  <code>position: relative;</code>, and then all child elements will draw from the top, right, bottom and left of this parent container. Using this knowledge, how would you go about achieving the following straightforward layout?</p>

			<p>Using <code>float</code>, you would need to wrap the items in a clearfix, float <code>.one</code> left, and fiddle with floats and margins on both <code>.two</code> and <code>.three</code>. You would end up with something similar to the following:</p>

			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
.parent {
	/* ghetto clearfix */
	width: 310px;
	overflow: auto;
}
.one {
	width: 200px;
	height: 210px;
	float: left;
}
.two {
	width: 100px;
	height: 100px;
	float: right;
	margin-bottom: 10px;
}
.three {
	width: 100px;
	height: 100px;
	float: right;
}</pre>
			<p>Using <code>position</code> allows us to, as described earlier, paint the elements on the screen with x and y co-ordinates in a very explicit way. While the above method with floats will break long lines down the page, the below method will keep everything in place, regardless of content.</p>

			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
.parent {
	position: relative;
	width: 310px;
	height: 210px;
}
.one, .two, .three {
	position: absolute;
}
.one {
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: 200px;
	height: 210px;
}
.two {
	top: 0;
	right: 0;
	width: 100px;
	height: 100px;
}
.three {
	bottom: 0;
	right: 0;
	width: 100px;
	height: 100px;
}</pre>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, there are <code>z-index</code> issues to be considered. While the above example might seem a bit excessive, once you start thinking with positions, it will opens a world of possibilities.</p>

		<div id="cssShorthand" class="entry">
			<h3>CSS Shorthand</h3>
			<h4>Grouping Properties</h4>
			<p>Grouping properties together is one of the single most effective methods to greatly reduce the size of a CSS file. It's important to understand how properties are ordered (clockwise - top, right, bottom, left) 
				and how they can be further shortened (top and bottom, left and right).</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
/* LONG CODE IS LONG */
padding-top: 1px;
padding-right: 2px;
padding-bottom: 1px;
padding-left: 2px;

/* BETTER */
padding: 1px 2px 1px 2px;

/* BEST */
padding: 1px 2px;</pre>
			<h4>From 0px to Hero</h4>
			<p>Assigning a unit type to a property value of zero is redundant. It is not important to know whether an element should be <code>0px</code> from the left or <code>0 elephants</code> from the left, just that it's bang on the left.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
/* BAD */
padding: 0px 10px;</pre>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
/* GOOD */
padding: 0 10px;</pre>
		</div>
		<div id="cssCommenting" class="entry">
			<h3>Commenting Blocks</h3>
			<p>Commenting large blocks of CSS is a great way of keeping track of multiple style areas within the one stylesheet. 
				Obviously it works better with single line CSS styles, but the effect is not entirely lost on multi-line either.
				The use of dashes versus equals versus underscores are all up the individual, but this is how I like to manage my stylesheets.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
/* === HORIZONTAL NAV === */
#horizNav { width: 100%; display: block; }
#horizNav li { display: block; float: left; position: relative; }
#horizNav li a { display: block; height: 30px; text-decoration: none; }
#horizNav li ul { display: none; position: absolute; top: 30; left: 0; }

/* === HOME PAGE - CAROUSEL === */
#carousel { width: 960px; height: 150px; position: relative; }
#carousel img { display: none; }
#carousel .buttons { position: absolute; right: 10px; bottom: 10px; }</pre>
		</div>
		<div id="cssClearingFloats" class="entry">
			<h3>Clearing Floats</h3>
			<p>Clearing a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> used to mean extra DOM, because it involved adding an extra clearer element. The better way is to set a specific width on the parent element ("auto" doesn't work in all browsers and scenarios) and an overflow value of either "auto" or "hidden". 
				"Hidden" obviously degrades better, but there are some IE compatibility versions where "auto" works better.</p>
			<h4>The HTML:</h4>
			<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;div class=&quot;parentElement&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;childElement&quot;&gt;
		I'm floated left!
	&lt;/div&gt;
	I'm normal text that wraps around the float
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
			<h4>The CSS:</h4>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
.parentElement {
	width: 100%;
	overflow: hidden;
}
.childElement {
	float: left;
}</pre>
			<p>Contributors have also brought the latest clearfix to my attention. The <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/" target="_blank">micro clear-fix</a>
				is considered stable and cross browser compliant enough to make it to the latest HTML5 boiler plate release. I <strong>highly</strong> recommend you check it out. 
				Although I am not a massive fan of browser-specific CSS and pseudo elements such as <code>:after</code>, the micro clearfix is definitely more robust. 
				It also prevents top margins from collapsing which is an absolute life saver.</p>

		<div id="cssCentering" class="entry">
			<h3>Vertical &amp; Horizontal Centering</h3>
			<p>Centering elements horizontally is not exactly rocket science, and I'm sure most of you are familiar with the following snippet:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
.class {
	width: 960px;
	margin: 0 auto;
}</pre>
			<p>Front end devs have been using this snippet for a long time, without fully understanding why it didn't work vertically. From my understanding, it's important to remember that the parent element will generally have a <code>height: auto;</code> on it, and that there is no 100% height in which to vertically center the element. Applying the <code>position: absolute;</code> effectively moves the element out into position mode and responds to the pushing and pulling of auto margins and no specific location. </p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
.exactMiddle {
	width: 100px;
	height: 100px;
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	right: 0;
	bottom: 0;
	left: 0;
	margin: auto;
}</pre>
			<p>The downsides of this method include its lack of support in IE6 and IE7, and the absence of a scroll bar if the browser is resized to be smaller than the centered object. There are more methods on <a href="http://blog.themeforest.net/tutorials/vertical-centering-with-css/" target="_blank">this page</a> (this is Method 4), but this is by far the best.</p> 
			<p>The vertical centering of text in an element is also straightforward. If the text is on a single line, like a horizontal navigation item, you can set the <code>line-height</code> to be that of the element's physical height.</p> 
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
#horizNav li {
	height: 32px;
	line-height: 32px;
}</pre>

		<div id="cssFeatureSniff" class="entry">
			<h3>Feature Sniff, Don't Browser Sniff</h3>
			<p>In the earlier discusison of JavaScript feature detection, applying properties if a browser is <em>any version</em> of IE is increasingly problematic.
				Man-of-steel Paul Irish pioneered the use of  <a href="http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/" target="_blank">IE version sniffing</a> to address this problem, but <a href="http://www.modernizr.com" target="_blank">Modernizr</a> has since come to the rescue.
				Modernizr places classes on the root <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element specifying whether features are supported. Bleeding edge styles can then easily cascade from (or be removed from) these classes.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
.my_elem {
   -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);
   -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);
   box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);
}

/* when box shadow isn't supported, use borders instead */
.no-boxshadow .my_elem {
   border: 1px solid #666;
   border-bottom-width: 2px;
}</pre>
		</div>
		<div id="cssImportant" class="entry">
			<h3>You're Not !important</h3>
			<p>A reliance upon the <code>!important</code> tag is a dangerous thing. The cases that warrant its use are rare and specific. They revolve around the necessity to override another stylesheet which you do not have access or permission to edit.
				Another scenario is hard coding an element's styles to prevent inline JavaScript styles from taking precedence. Instead <code>!important</code> is used as a lazy shortcut to set the priority of your style over another, causing headaches further down the line.</p>
			<p>The use of the <code>!important</code> tag can be mostly avoided via the better understanding of CSS selector precedence, and how to better target elements. The more specific the selector, the more likely it will be accepted as the applicable style.
				The following example from vanseodesign demonstrates the specificity at work.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
p { font-size: 12px; }
p.bio { font-size: 14px; }</pre>
			<p><a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/css/css-specificity-inheritance-cascaade/" target="_blank">Their article</a> on style precedence does a better job explaining inheritence than I ever could, so please give it a go.</p>

		<div id="cssDegradation" class="entry">
			<h3>Aggressive Degradation</h3>
			<p>It's worth noting that this is a personal opinion, and best suited to very specific situations. The stance of aggressive degradation will not be well received in large commercial projects or enterprise solutions relying upon older browsers.</p>
			<p>Aggressive degradation dictates that if a particular (older) browser cannot render a certain effect, it should simply be omitted. A CSS3 button is a good example. 
				Effects such as <code>border-radius</code>, <code>box-shadow</code>, <code>text-shadow</code> and <code>gradients</code> will be displayed in cutting edge browsers.
				A graceful fallback of a <code>.PNG</code> would be provided for slightly older browsers, and the most graceful of all solutions would include a PNG-Fix for IE6 or the use of <code>filter</code> arguments to replicate gradients and shadows.
				However, aggressive degradation in this situation instructs you to neglect the older browsers and present them with a flat, satisfactory object.</p>
			<p>Put simply, aggressive degradation boils down to: <strong>if your browser can't render a gradient or a box shadow, tough luck</strong>.</p>
			<p>While not ideal for every situation, it ensures the timely delivery of projects and that the root product is still usable and not reliant on (validation breaking) hacks.</p>

			<h3>Feature Sniff with Modernizr</h3>

		<div id="cssHtmlFontFace" class="entry">
			<h3>@font-face Use and Abuse</h3>
			<p>Before you consider embedding a custom font, is important that you inspect the <abbr>EULA</abbr> and check if web embedding is allowed. Foundries are understandably reluctant to allow designers and developers
				the ability to place font files directly on a server which can then be copied by a savvy end user. Particular foundries also prohibit the embedding of particular file types, such as <code>.TTF</code> and <code>.OTF</code>.</p>
			<p>If, after careful consideration, you believe the desired font is web embeddable: head on over to the Font Squirrel <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator" target="_blank">@font-face Generator</a>. 
				It utilises Fontspring's <a href="http://www.fontspring.com/blog/further-hardening-of-the-bulletproof-syntax" target="_blank">bulletproof @font-face structure</a> and automatically generates all the required file formats.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="cssHtmlDegradation" class="entry">
			<h3>Degradation</h3>
			<p>Thankfully browser handling of unsupported HTML5 and CSS3 is already that of a graceful nature. New additions to the list of <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> types such as "email", "search" etc. will generally
				degrade to normal <code>&lt;input type="text" /&gt;</code> when not natively supported. Similarly, CSS3 properties that aren't supported will simply not appear. Responsive layouts controlled by height and width
				media queries are simply not applied. </p>
